### About ###

BE Mod 1 project for Turing School of Software and Design. Encrypts and decrypts messages given via command line interface. 

### Functionality ###

Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.

### Object Oriented Programming ###

Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. 
Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.


### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics ###

Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

### Test Driven Development ###

Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). Git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code.

Obvious edge cases addressed: using special characters. Test coverage using SimpleCov above 99%.
